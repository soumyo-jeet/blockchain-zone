### ***Bitcoin***
Bitcoin is a protocol on which the blockchain technology is implemented to create a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. It was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and was released as open-source software in 2009.

### ***Monetary System***
- **Limited Supply**: Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, making it scarce and potentially deflationary.
- **Decentralized**: No central authority controls the issuance or management of Bitcoin, ensuring that no single entity can manipulate the currency.
- **Peer-to-Peer Transactions**: Transactions are conducted directly between users without requiring intermediaries like banks or payment processors.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger (blockchain), allowing anyone to verify the history of any Bitcoin address.
- **Security**: The blockchain's cryptographic nature ensures that transactions are secure and tamper-proof.
- **Halving Events**: Approximately every four years, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, reducing the rate at which new bitcoins are created and contributing to scarcity.
- **Block Frequency**: New blocks are added to the Bitcoin blockchain approximately every 10 minutes, ensuring a steady flow of transactions.

### ***Noances***
An unique, arbitrary number miners repeatedly change and hash with other block data until they find a hash meeting the network's difficulty target.
- **How Mining Works**: 
    - `Block Assembly`: Miners gather transactions into a new block.
    - `Nonce Addition`: A random or sequential nonce is added to the block's header.
    - `Hashing`: The entire block data, including the nonce, is hashed.
    - `Validation`: Miners check if the resulting hash meets the difficulty requirement (e.g., starts with a certain number of zeros).
    - `Iteration`: If not valid, the miner changes the nonce and tries again, repeating the process until a valid hash is found.
    - `Reward`: The first miner to find the correct nonce adds the block and gets rewarded.
